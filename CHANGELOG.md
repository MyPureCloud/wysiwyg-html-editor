##### 0.2.6

* Adds localization for link tooltip strings

##### 0.2.5

* Minor text changes

##### 0.2.4

* Fixes the localization of "sub-locale" languages (zh-CN, pt-BR, etc)

##### 0.2.3

* (0.2.1 and 0.2.2 were created while getting our publishing system nailed down, no real changes)
* Removes the image button

### 0.2.0

* QuillJS upgraded to 1.0.0 (previously used a beta release of 1.0.0)
* Added "insert image" button to toolbar (reverted in 0.2.3)

### 0.1.0

* Links are automatically prefixed with `https://`, if they don't start with `http*`.  This seems like a sensible default behavior, so no option was added; but one could be added if this behavior is undesirable in some case.

* Miscellaneous package.json changes that shouldn't affect the functionality of the widget

### 0.0.x

Prehistory.  Leading archeologists believe that HTML was carved directly onto stone tablets during this time.
